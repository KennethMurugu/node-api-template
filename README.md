# Setting Up

This template uses Express to build the API endpoints. `tsc-watch` will be used to start the server and restart it when changes to source files are made.

## Install dependencies

Use `npm install` to install dependencies.

# Running everything

Use `npm run dev` or `npm run prod` to start the server. `tsc-watch` will watch for changes in the `src` directory and compile `.ts` files to `.js` in the `dist` directory.
